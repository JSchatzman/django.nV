##Vulnerability 1 (A1 - Injection)

##Exposure

#####We found an instance of sql injection vulnerability.  To exploit this, I navigated to the file upload page for a project and entered in the following file path: 'testPic',(select password from auth_user where username='admin'),8);--''.  This was supposed to reveal the admin password but I was not able to locate it.

##Repair

#####To fix this vulnerability, use the Django ORM which handles malicious form inouts.  Avoid using direct ORM methods like curs.execute().
